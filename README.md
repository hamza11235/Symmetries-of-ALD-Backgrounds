# Higher-Form Symmetries of Asymtotically Linear Dilaton (ALD) backgrounds

This repository is related to computations regarding higher-form symmetries in ALD backgrounds. The motivation behind this is the fact that these backgrounds are conjectured to be dual
to Little String Theories (LSTs), which have a known set of higher-form symmetries. To investigate these symmetries on the ALD side of the duality, we linearize Einstein's Field Equations 
using numerical methods (xAct package in Mathematica) around an ALD solution, and consider conserved currents in the resulting theory.
